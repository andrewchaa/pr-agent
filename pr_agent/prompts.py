            ticket_prefix: Expected ticket prefix (e.g., "STAR", "JIRA", "ENG")

        return f"""Extract the ticket number from this git branch name: "{branch_name}"

The ticket number typically starts with "{ticket_prefix}" followed by a dash and numbers.
Common formats include:
- {ticket_prefix}-12345
- {ticket_prefix.lower()}-12345
- {ticket_prefix.upper()}-12345

Branch name variations:
- feature/{ticket_prefix}-123-description
- {ticket_prefix}-123-some-feature
- bugfix-{ticket_prefix.lower()}-456-fix
- {ticket_prefix.lower()}_789_something
- and many other creative formats

Instructions:
1. Look for the ticket identifier in the branch name
2. Return ONLY the ticket number in the format: {ticket_prefix.upper()}-[number]
3. If you find the ticket, return just the ticket like: {ticket_prefix.upper()}-12345
4. If no ticket number is found, return exactly: NONE

Examples:
- "star-422270-test" → STAR-422270
- "feature/STAR-12345-add-auth" → STAR-12345
- "bugfix_star_999_memory_leak" → STAR-999
- "some-branch-without-ticket" → NONE

Now extract from: "{branch_name}"

- Use 1-2 bullet points maximum, or a single concise statement

- Only list REAL, concrete production impacts (performance degradation, breaking changes, data loss risk, etc.)
- Do NOT mention risks that are "minimal", "unlikely", or "low" - if a risk is minimal, skip it entirely
- Do NOT include generic "testing needed" points - assume all changes need testing
- Do NOT list theoretical risks that apply to any code change
- If truly low-risk: say "Low-risk change" or "No significant production impact expected"
- Be specific and actionable, not vague

Examples of GOOD impact statements:
- Breaking change: Removes deprecated API endpoint used by mobile app
- Performance: Database migration will lock table for ~5 minutes

Examples of BAD impact statements (DO NOT write these):
- Testing needed: Verify that changes don't break workflows
- Security risk: Could introduce vulnerabilities, though likely minimal
- Compatibility concern: Might affect existing configurations
